### 1.Create a new project with the CDS cli.

` cds init competition-corner`

### 2. Create  data model 

Create a new file called 'data-model.cds' in the /db folder.

```cds 
namespace my.event;

using {
    cuid,
    managed
} from '@sap/cds/common'; // import reuse packages that are already provided by the framework

entity Competitions { 
    key ID          : Integer;
        name        : String;
        type        : String;
        description : String;
        city        : String;
        country     : String;
        user        : Association to many Users ; // namaged association without a manual foreign key.
}


entity Users {
    key ID          : Integer;
        firstName   : String;
        lastName    : String;
        age         : Integer;
        city        : String;
        country     : String;

        competition : Association to many Competitions
                          on competition.user = $self;
}

```

### 3.Create a service definition

Create a new file in the /srv folder called 'competition-service.cds'.

```
using my.event as my from '../db/data-model';

service CompetitionService { // a service is a http endpoit. The visible part of an OData service.
    entity Competition   as projection on my.Competitions;
    entity User          as projection on my.Users;
    }

```

### 4. Deploy the service to a persistence layer

The OData service has no storage, so we will install a local SQLite DB as a first step.

``` npm install -D sqlite3```

After deploy the data model and service definition to a new SQLite-based database.

``` cds deploy --to sqlite:competition-corner-demo.db ```

Explore the database with the command :

```sqlite3 competition-corner.db```

### 5. Connect the SQLTools from SAP BAS to the the local SQLite DB.

File>Preferences>Open Preferences >sqltools > connections

### 6. Load data from CSV files

Create a new folder in the /db folder called /data.
Create the CSV files based on the naming conventions.
Deploy to the BD wit 'CDS deploy'.

### 7. Insert a new competition from BAS http plug-in.

```json
### Insert a new competition
POST http://localhost:4004/competition/Competition
Content-Type: application/json

{
"ID": 10,
"name": "Roma Marathon",
"type": "Running Competition",
"description": "The biggest running marathon from Italy",
"city": "Roma",
"country": "Italy",
"user_ID": null
}

### List all competitions
GET http://localhost:4004/competition/Competition

```

### 8. Insert a new user from BAS http plug-in.
```json
### Get all users
GET http://localhost:4004/competition/User

### Add a new User

POST http://localhost:4004/competition/User
Content-Type: application/json

{
"ID":20,
"firstName":"Ion",
"lastName":"Popescu",
"age": 20,
"city":"Bucuresti",
"country":"Romania"
}
```
### 9. Defining a second service
I will create a second service that sits on top of the same data model.
You can define as many services on the same data model as you need, either in the same service definition file, or in separate files.

In the data-model.cds create a new entity:

```cds

entity Registrations:cuid,managed { //administrative fields provided by the cds
    competition: Association to Competitions;
    user: Association to  Users;
}

```
Add a new service definition:

```cds

entity Registrations as projection on my.Registrations

```
Deploy the chages to the DB.

Add a registration with the BAS http plug-in.

```json
### Create a competition registration
POST http://localhost:4004/competition/Registrations
Content-Type: application/json

{
"competition_ID": 1 ,
"user_ID":1
}

```

### 10. Add custom logic

Create a 'competition-service.js' in the srv folder.

### 9.Common Types & Aspects @sap/cds/common

### 11. Deploy to Hana Cloud.



When youâ€™re moving from the development phase to the production phase, use SAP HANA Cloud as your database.

Add support for Hana with 'cds add hana' command.

This configures deployment for SAP HANA to use the hdbtable and hdbview formats.

Add the mta.yaml file with the command 'cds add mta'

Build the application archive with command 'mbt build'

Update the mta.yaml file  with 'cds add mta --force'

cf deploy mta_archives/competition-corner-demo_1.0.0.mtar

### 12. Add the UI layer

Add an UI layer using the Fiori Template.
